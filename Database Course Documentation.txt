1. Comparison Assignment: Flat File Systems vs. Relational Databases

Flat File System (think VERY simple)
Data stored in one file (like Excel or a text file)

Relational Database (a bit smarter)
Data stored in many tables, and tables are connected

Flat File = Simple, one file, repeated data
Relational DB = Many tables, connected, less repetition


Flat File System vs Relational Database
| Point               | Flat File System                                             | Relational Database                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
|   Structure         | Data is stored in one single file (like one Excel sheet)     | Data is stored in multiple tables connected together     |
|   Data Redundancy   | High (same data is repeated many times)                      | Low (data is stored once and reused)                     |
|   Relationships     | No real relationships between data                           | Tables are linked using keys (relationships exist)       |
|   Example Usage     | Small programs, simple lists, text files                     | Banks, schools, hospitals, large systems                 |
|   Drawbacks         | Hard to update, data repetition, errors                      | More complex, needs database software                    |

3. Roles in a Database System
| Role                  | What they do                             | Key Word   |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ---------- |
| System Analyst        | Understands the problem and requirements | Understand |
| Database Designer     | Designs database structure               | Design     |
| Database Developer    | Builds database using SQL                | Build      |
| DBA                   | Manages and protects database            | Protect    |
| Application Developer | Builds the application                   | Interface  |
| BI Developer          | Analyzes data and makes reports          | Analyze    |

One Sentence to Remember All Roles 
Understand → Design → Build → Protect → Use → Analyze

4. Types of Databases

Relational vs Non-Relational Comparison

| Feature        | Relational DB | Non-Relational DB     |
| -------------- | ------------- | --------------------- |
| Data Structure | Tables        | Documents / Key-Value |
| Schema         | Fixed         | Flexible              |
| Relationships  | Yes           | Limited or No         |
| Scalability    | Moderate      | High                  |
| Examples       | MySQL         | MongoDB, Cassandra    |

Centralized vs. Distributed vs. Cloud Databases
 Centralized Database

Stored in one location

One main server

Use Case:

Small company

School system

Disadvantage:

If the server fails, the system stops
 Distributed Database

Data stored in multiple locations

Connected through a network

Use Case:

Banks with many branches

Large organizations

Advantage:

Better performance and reliability

Cloud Database

Stored on the internet

Managed by cloud providers

Examples:

AWS

Google Cloud

Microsoft Azure

Use Case:

Online shopping websites

Mobile and web applications
