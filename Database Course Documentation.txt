1. Comparison Assignment: Flat File Systems vs. Relational Databases

Flat File System (think VERY simple)
Data stored in one file (like Excel or a text file)

Relational Database (a bit smarter)
Data stored in many tables, and tables are connected

Flat File = Simple, one file, repeated data
Relational DB = Many tables, connected, less repetition


Flat File System vs Relational Database
| Point               | Flat File System                                             | Relational Database                                      |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
|   Structure         | Data is stored in one single file (like one Excel sheet)     | Data is stored in multiple tables connected together     |
|   Data Redundancy   | High (same data is repeated many times)                      | Low (data is stored once and reused)                     |
|   Relationships     | No real relationships between data                           | Tables are linked using keys (relationships exist)       |
|   Example Usage     | Small programs, simple lists, text files                     | Banks, schools, hospitals, large systems                 |
|   Drawbacks         | Hard to update, data repetition, errors                      | More complex, needs database software                    |
